    Sample dyanmic web page example -- HTML / CSS / Javascript

    This is a super-simple recreation of a project I did - a web page for a 
    small used car dealer driven by an Excel spreadsheet that holds the
    inventory.

    The usage flow was:

        - update the spreadsheet with the inventory information.
        - export a JSON version of the data on the spreadsheet (VB script)
        - html/javascript the JSON file in to create a dynamic web page.
    
    Not designed to be pretty - the colors are used to identify the
    different div's and elements.

    For development, I load jquery locally; for production you can get it from
    a CDN: 

  <script src="scripts/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js">
-->

<head>
  <title>Car Dealer Website Demo</title>

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheets/cardealer.css"/>
  <style type="stylesheets/cardealer.css"></style>

  <script src="scripts/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/inventory.js"></script>

</head>

<body>
<!--

   The body is anchored by a container that holds everything:

        - a header at the top
        - a navigation panel on the left
        - the "main" page, which will display inventory for sale
        - a footer at the bottom

    The "inventory.js" script will process the JSON of the inventory,
    creating a "car" <div> for each item and appending it to the div main.

-->
    <div id="container">
        <div id="header">
            <p>
 	    <h1>Car Dealer Website Demo</h1>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
          <div id="nav">
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a class="selected" href="">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="main">

            <h3>This is the main</h3>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="footer">
            <h4>This is the footer</h4>
